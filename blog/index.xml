      <description>Fork this project in Github here Get the data in Kaggle here  Earlier this year, I saw this post in r/dataisbeautiful showing the representation of generations in the US Senate. After seeing it, I just knew I had to make one for our Senate.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as I&amp;rsquo;m cramming to finish this site before this year ends. To start this blog, I thought I could share one of my first milestones as an early career researcher&amp;ndash;my first international conference presentation!
This is me presenting our work entitled &amp;ldquo;The Influence of Warmer Sea Surface Temperatures on Southwest Monsoon Rainfall in the Philippines&amp;rdquo; in the Climate Change, Monsoon and Extreme Weather Events session (AS-03-26) of the Asia-Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS) 11th Annual Meeting in Sapporo, Japan last July 29, 2014.</description>
