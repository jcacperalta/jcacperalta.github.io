<p>Earlier this year, I saw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/l1yly6/oc_which_generation_controls_the_senate/">this post</a> in r/dataisbeautiful showing the representation of generations in the US Senate. After seeing it, I just knew I had to make one for our Senate.</p>
<p>Here is the completed visualization. Each tile represents a Philippine Senator. I based the design from the original post, but the major innovation I made is that I added hover interactions using the python library <a href="https://bokeh.org/">Bokeh</a>.</p>
<p>I invite you to hover on the tiles and check out whats written on them!</p>

<h3 id="what-can-we-say-about-the-chart">What can we say about the chart?<a class="anchor" href="#what-can-we-say-about-the-chart">#</a></h3>
<p>Here are some of the insights from the chart and dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The present Congress is run by <em>equal numbers of Generation X and Baby Boomers</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The median age of a Philippine Senator is <em>55 years</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The youngest Senate batch so far (median age of 49 years) was elected during the <em>Seventeenth Congress</em>, while the oldest batch was elected during the <em>Eleventh Congress</em> (median age of 59.5 years)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The most generation-monopolized senate batch was elected during the Sixth Congress, with <em>29/32</em> slots filled by Greatest Generation senators.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, Thirteenth to Sixteenth Congress has the most diverse generation mix with <em>4 generations</em> represented (with Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile bringing his own lone generation in the mix)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first Silent generation to be elected was <em>Sen. Benigno &ldquo;Ninoy&rdquo; Aquino</em>, Jr. (34 years old) in the Sixth Congress, while the first Baby Boomer to be elected is <em>Sen. Jose Lina</em> (36 years old) in the Eight Congress</p>

<li>
<p>ALL Senate batches had at least one <em>septuagenarian</em> (someone in their 70s) colleague, EXCEPT during the Eight Congress when the oldest senator was Sen. Raul Maglapus at 69 years old.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The youngest elected Senators are <em>Sen. Bam Aquino III</em> and <em>Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV</em> at 36 years old at the year of Fourteenth and Sixteenth Congress respectively. If we&rsquo;re talking about months, then <em>Sen. Bam Aquino III</em> holds the youngest elected senator, being 3 months older than the latter at time of their election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But they were not the first of his generation to be elected: <em>Sen. Pia Cayetano</em> and <em>Sen. Bong Revilla</em> (both 38 years old) were the first Generation X to be elected during the Thirteenth congress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The oldest elected senator is <em>Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile</em> during the Sixteenth Congress (89 years old).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We still have yet to elect a millenial Senator. To compare, U.S. already had its first millenial Senator (Sen Jon Ossoff, 33 years old) during its 2020 elections.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><mark>From the charts, it seems like <em>the first senator from a new generation is elected every 20 years</em>.</mark></p>
<p><mark>The BIG QUESTION is—will we see our first elected millenial senator in 2022?</mark></p>

On the coding side of things, I think this viz is easy to make and will be great for those of you who want to start learning how to make interactive charts in python. 
<h3 id="but-firsthow-were-the-generations-defined">But first—how were the generations defined?<a class="anchor" href="#but-firsthow-were-the-generations-defined">#</a></h3>
<p>There are many ways to name generations (I&rsquo;m no sociologist, so I&rsquo;d defer to the sociologists reading this blog to assess if I made the right choice). For this visualization, I chose to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss%E2%80%93Howe_generational_theory">Strauss-Howe definition of generations</a>.</p>
<p>These two folks, Neil Howe and William Strauss, defined generational cohorts in the U.S. as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>2000 to present : Generation Z (or New Silent Generation)</li>
<li>1980 to 2000: Millennials (or Generation Y)</li>
<li>1965 to 1979: Generation X</li>
<li>1946 to 1964: Baby Boomers</li>
<li>1925 to 1945: the Silent Generation</li>
<li>1900 to 1924: the Greatest (or G.I.) Generation</li>
<li>1883 to 1900: Lost Generation</li>
<li>1860 to 1882: Missionary Generation</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I introduced a change in the classification and renamed the Missionary Generation as</p>
<ul>
<li>1860 to 1882: Revolutionary Generation</li>
</ul>
<p>since I didnt feel that the missionary keyword (about US expansion to the west coast) applied well in our country&rsquo;s context. I renamed it as &ldquo;Revolutionary generation&rdquo; because it was at this time when our ancestors started brewing their resistance against Sapnish rule, with notable events like the GomBurZa executions(1872). This is highly contentious so let me know if you agree or disagree with this. Suggestions are always welcome!</p>
<h3 id="where-did-the-data-come-from">Where did the data come from?<a class="anchor" href="#where-did-the-data-come-from">#</a></h3>
<p>There wasnt any machine-readable format of PH Senator profiles (full names, birthday and birthplace) when I checked the Web, so to be able to create the viz, I had to manually encode the data in the <a href="https://legacy.senate.gov.ph/senators/senlist.asp">legacy page of the official Philippine Senate Website</a> from the First Congress(1946) up to present.</p>
<p>Whenever a detail is not present/seemingly erroneous in the profiles at the website, I sourced and cross-referenced the detail from the senators' official or wiki pages, and news articles.</p>
<p>All in all I have scraped <em>458</em> senator profiles. It took me around <em>6 hours spread in 3 days</em> to finish encoding the dataset.</p>
<p>You may download the dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jcacperalta/senators-of-the-philippines-1st-to-18th-congress">Kaggle</a>. Please message me if you find any inconsistencies in the data.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-tools-i-used">What are the tools I used?<a class="anchor" href="#what-are-the-tools-i-used">#</a></h3>
<p>I used <code>pandas</code> to read and analyze the dataset, <code>matplotlib</code> to make some basic plots, and the categorical heat map in <code>bokeh</code> to make the final interactive chart.</p>
<p>I invite you to look at and try out the jupyter notebook in this <a href="https://github.com/user/jcacperalta/ph_senate_gen_viz">Github repo</a></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Thats it—hope you found this plot useful and insightful! Enjoy coding!</p>
