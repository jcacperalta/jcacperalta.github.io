      <description>Fork this project in Github here Get the data in Kaggle here  Earlier this year, I saw this post in r/dataisbeautiful showing the representation of generations in the US Senate. After seeing it, I just knew I had to make one for our Senate.
Here is the completed visualization. I based the design from the original post, but the major innovation I made is that I added hover interactions using the python library Bokeh.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post as I&amp;rsquo;m cramming to finish this site before this year ends. To start this blog, I thought I could share one of my first milestones as an early career researcher&amp;ndash;my first international conference presentation!
This is me presenting our work entitled &amp;ldquo;The Influence of Warmer Sea Surface Temperatures on Southwest Monsoon Rainfall in the Philippines&amp;rdquo; in the Climate Change, Monsoon and Extreme Weather Events session (AS-03-26) of the Asia-Oceania Geosciences Society (AOGS) 11th Annual Meeting in Sapporo, Japan last July 29, 2014.</description>

      <description>Thanks for stopping by!
I am currently a data scientist at the Commercial Operations Division of AC Energy Philippines where I create and deploy market forecasting models and provide weather/climate insights for power trading.
Prior to that, I trained for 6 years as a climate scientist and earned my masters in Atmospheric Science from Ateneo de Manila University last 2019. My topics of interest include regional monsoon dynamics, data validation techniques and climate model evaluation.</description>
